#!Question name:Q1 - Question Name
#!Question marks:10
#!Marking resolution:5
#!Evaluation criteria weight|description:
2|First evaluation criteria of question one
2|Second evaluation criteria of question one
2|Third evaluation criteria of question one
1|Ns evaluation criteria of question one
1|Another evaluation criteria, can have as many as practical
1|And the numbers before the bar represents the marks for each criteria
1|last criteria, the sum of the numbers should be equal to the question marks
#!Standard Feedback options:
Well done
Each line is a possible feedback sentence that can be quickly added to the feedback given to the student
The common feedbacks should be placed here, not really a very specific one
For specific feedback, you can add it by pressing the corresponding button
If you find that there is a specific feedback that keeps happening, you can add it during marking
This last option is usually the most efficient way of making this list
The correct answers for each criteria can also be added here if you want

#!Question name:Q2 - Model Simulations
#!Question marks:8
#!Marking resolution:5
#!Evaluation criteria weight|description:
3|Plot histograms of the hist and histNat simulations
1|Simple evaluation of the two simulations. NatHis vs early OBS
1|Simple evaluation of the two simulations. His vs late OBS
3|Plot normal probability density functions (PDFs) for both the hist and histNat scenarios
#!Standard Feedback options:
Well done
Figure labels are missing (axes must include units where appropriate, legend is needed is multiple variables are shown)
Histogram of the hist and histNat simulations missing
PDFs plots missing
Hottest and second hottest observed years not indicated
Simple simulation evaluation missing
Summary statistics of the simulation evaluation missing
Assessment of the NatHist simulation agreement with early observation data missing
Assessment of the Hist simulation agreement with late observation data missing
Assessment of the simulation agreement needed more details for full marks
The early years of the observed data was slightly warmer than the NatHist and less variable, why could this be the case?
